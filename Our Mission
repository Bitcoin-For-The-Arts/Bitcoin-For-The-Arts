“In the sovereign spirit of Bitcoin—uncensorable money for uncensorable minds—we ignite a self-sustaining global renaissance in art. Through Bitcoin micro-grants, performance workshops, and visionary live and digital productions, we empower visual artists, playwrights, dancers, musicians, writers, storytellers, and filmmakers to break free from fiat decay. Every donation fuels direct support to creators, powers world-class exhibitions and residencies, and plants a seed in a permanent Bitcoin reserve—building an eternal endowment for human creativity that no institution or inflation can ever touch.”
Vision: Be the NEA of the Bitcoin Era — the universal funder of interdisciplinary artists, powered by the hardest money ever known.
